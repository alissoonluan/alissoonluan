### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I've been a software developer since 2019 with experience in web development.

Currently, my focus is working with ReactJs and NodeJs, but, I usually I develop more backend with NodeJS.
</br>
Great experience with NodeJs, ReactJs, Express, Serverless, Pipelines, CI/CD, MaterialUI, Styled Components, PHP, Laravel, MVC, JIRA, Agile Methodology (SCRUM, KANBAN), Github, Javascript, Typescript, Jquery, Bootstrap, HTML, CSS, JWT, RabbitMQ, AWS, Azure and Docker.

Curious, thirsty to learn, and self-taught. I'm always learning and improving in my free time.
